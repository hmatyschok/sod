Simple sign-on service on demand daemon (sod)
=============================================

Environment: FreeBSD 10.x-RELEASE

WARNING: This software is WRITTEN from SCRATCH during a rapid
WARNING: developement session and contains some (serious FLAWS).

This daemon provides (due to its early implementation status) only simple 
user authentication. All with pam(8) subsystem collaborating components are 
utilizing pthread(3) API throught an experimental approach to develope an 
object oriented Service Component Architechture (SCA) providing an interface 
for the backend of web-applications (or other funny things).

Further, communication between backend and pam(8) is provided by using socket 
API. Transactions are mapped in AF_UNIX domain. See by unix(4) denoted manual 
page for further details.

This provides a strict isolation between the domain of given backend 
and pam(8) subsystem. 

 -> https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pam&manpath=FreeBSD+10.3-stable

Now, it is up to the pam(8) subsystem to handle (or forward) service requests 
targeting local user data base (not recommondated, but possible - self 
explanatory) or to remote sites managing user credentials.

Further, the present implementation is far from completeness and correctness.

Current raw developement roadmap:
---------------------------------

 1. Structural reorganisation of given set of Makefiles. :-) 
  
 2. Activities in regarding to adding more  components around user
    authentication services are still underway and in progress.

 3. An experimental lightwight user session model based on db(3) API 
    and access to other pam(3) service facilities are current issues.

 4. Complete reorganisation of given library into a group of libraries.
    Any component will be redefined as single library.
 
 5. Implementation of a JNI still encapsulating authentication 
    requests is planned for demonstration purposes.
